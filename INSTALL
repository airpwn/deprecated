Submin Installation
-------------------

When installing from tarball, please run:

  sh bin/install.sh /usr/local

to install submin in /usr/local. You can then run /usr/local/bin/submin-admin
to create your submin project (multiple seperate projects are possible). This
program will show some help, but for a quick start, just run:

  /usr/local/bin/submin-admin create default

and it will create files in /etc/submin, /var/lib/submin. Please note that
you have to include one of the generated apache files in /etc/submin/ to your
apache2 config.

If any instructions are not clear, please file a bug (see 'development' on the
website).
